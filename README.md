Denovo automata platform , is an ongoin project for Computational life sciences using open source tools  to support  citizen scinence community
in a nutshell, it's like  discovery studio and openeye's toolsets but open source 
#

# Built using dotnet runtime 

with FFI - IPC and transpilation of other tools writen in other languages .
