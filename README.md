# DNA-platform
DeNovo Automata platform , is an ongoin WIP project for Computational life sciences utlizaing  open source tools  to support  open scinence community
The goal is to develop a unifed  low code / no code platform for all sort of applications in pharmaceutical  bioinformatic
#

# Built using dotnet runtime 

with FFI - IPC and transpilation of other tools writen in other languages .

and might be possible to be extendable with cloud native computing foundation tools like dapr,,Synapse,kuberflow etc..
Also as a PoC I develop a polyglot runtime kernel for jupyternotebook with an MCP services. 
next step to enabel user to visually create nodes diagrams for MARL systems .

# helpful resource for terminolgoy 

you can find in this repo wiki  https://github.com/PrestigeDevop/DNA-platform/wiki/some-terminology
an overview of these computational techniques used in life sciences.  suitable for introductory explanations or quick references in the field 


# services and tools:

TODO:
[]- Poc.ipynb # WIP 
[]- polyglot runtime kernel #WIP sorta working prototype 
[]- Integrated mcp backend services # sorta done
[]- The webUI frontend # lightweight client is done ~ better approaches e.g authoring workflow piplines visually under investigation
