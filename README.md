# DNA-platform
DeNovo Automata platform , is an ongoin WIP project for Computational life sciences utlizaing  open source tools  to support  open scinence community
The goal is to develop a unifed  low code / no code platform for all sort of applications in pharmaceutical  bioinformatic
#

# Built using dotnet runtime 

with FFI - IPC and transpilation of other tools writen in other languages .

and might be possible to be extendable with cloud native computing foundation tools like dapr,,Synapse,kuberflow etc..
